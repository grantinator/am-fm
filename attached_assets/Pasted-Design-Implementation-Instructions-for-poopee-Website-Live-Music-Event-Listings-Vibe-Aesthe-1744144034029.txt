Design Implementation Instructions for "poopee" Website (Live Music Event Listings)

‚ú® Vibe & Aesthetic Overview
The site should look like a gritty, underground events listing page with artistic edge and clarity. Inspiration is taken from The Laundromat SF and Bar Part Time, but tailored for a rock-forward vibe. Here's the breakdown:

üé® Color Palette
Background: Very dark purple (#0d001a or #120017) ‚Äî nearly black but with a subtle warmth.

Primary Text Color: Muted yellow-cream (#ffe89e or #f5e3b3) ‚Äî not neon, but clearly visible.

Accent Elements: Slightly desaturated red or orange accents for hover states or buttons (#ff6a00 or #f24d38).

üñãÔ∏è Typography
Header Font: Grungy or distressed serif, ideally something with rock poster energy. If custom font isn‚Äôt available, use:

Playfair Display, Libre Baskerville, or IM Fell English SC as a base.

Body Font: Simple sans-serif like Inter, Space Grotesk, or Montserrat for readability.

Font Styling:

All lowercase branding (‚Äúpoopee‚Äù) in header.

Generous letter spacing (letter-spacing: 0.05em) on all caps elements like dates.

üß± Layout & Structure
Page Structure:

A scrollable single column feed grouped by date.

Each section should start with a date heading (e.g., "April 8, 2025") followed by event cards.

Event Cards:

Cards include:

Event title

Artists

Time

RSVP count

Poster (provided by user uploads ‚Äî don't apply styles here)

Clean, responsive layout. Maintain 1‚Äì2 column layout on large screens and stack on mobile.

üé® Decorative Details
Header section should include small, edgy line-drawings:

Crescent moon, sparkles/stars, skull, flame, etc.

These should be subtle and not folk-ish ‚Äî keep them sketchy or rough.

Doodles should appear around the site header only (avoid cluttering event cards).

Use wavy or dashed dividers between date sections for a handmade feel.
