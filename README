# Starting the app

## Setting up postgres 
1. Install postgres with `brew install postgresql`
2. I followed this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RySuQtMiBxQ
3. Create a .env file in root and add `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<pass>@localhost:5432/<db_name>`with whatever values used in video
4. In postgres copy paste the comamnd in create_table.sql to create the table. (its two commands you maybe want to run as two seperate ones)

## Starting app
1. Run `vite dev` at the root of the project to start frontend and backend together.
